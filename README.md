## 📍 Overview

POSEmotion is an advanced emotion recognition system that enhances text-based emotion classification by integrating grammatical insights from Parts-Of-Speech (POS) tagging. This project demonstrates how combining a custom POS tagger with machine learning techniques boosts accuracy in recognizing emotions.

---

## 👾 Features

<b>Custom POS Tagger:</b> Built using the Viterbi Algorithm to extract grammatical insights from text.

<b>Emotion Classification:</b> Recognizes six distinct emotions using TF-IDF, Naive Bayes, and SVM.

<b>POS-Enhanced Model:</b> Integrates POS tags into the emotion recognition pipeline for improved accuracy.

<b>Performance Evaluation:</b> Provides detailed metrics to assess model performance.
